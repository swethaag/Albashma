            </h5>
            <p>Applying for a Dubai industrial license is a straightforward process, and here’s a stepwise summary of the procedure:
            </p>
            <div class="col">
              <h6>1. Collaborate with a business licensing expert
              </h6>
              <p> If you’re considering applying for an industrial license in the UAE, the first step is to find a business formation expert you can trust to manage the procedure on your behalf, such as Shuraa. This alleviates the stress of starting a company. And it guarantees that your paperwork will be thorough and accurate.</p>
              <h6>2. Secure administrative approvals
              </h6>
              <p>If you want to open a factory to run your business, you must first obtain approval from the right authorities. If you plan to conduct business from an existing location, such as a free economic zone, you won’t need to worry about this step.</p>
              <h6>3. Submit your application for obtaining an industrial license
              </h6>
              <p> The next step is to submit an application for an industrial license in Dubai. If you are establishing a business on the mainland, you can immediately contact the DED. However, if you want to run your business in a free zone, you can submit a request to the relevant free zone authorities.<br>
                The expert corporate advisors at Shuaa will design and maintain your applications regardless of where you setup your company (mainland or free zone)..</p>
                <h6>4. Obtain additional approvals
                </h6>
                <p>You’ll need to get certain additional licenses before you can operate in the UAE with an industrial license. The authoritative bodies for your Dubai industrial license include:<br>
                  The Chamber of Commerce and Industry<br>
                  The Industrial Register<br>
                  The Ministry of Health<br>
                  A company formation professional can obtain all these permits on your behalf.
                </p>
                <h6>5. Manage Visas
                </h6>
                <p> You must register for a UAE visa before you can conduct your industrial business activities. To do so, you can apply for a visa at the same time as you apply for a business license. Shuraa also, handles visa applications along with your license for you. Moreover, it’s also possible to sponsor people, such as your kids, spouse, or relatives, for UAE visas.</p>
