            Did you also know that a professional license in Dubai may allow 100% ownership for foreign investors? Professional trade license also permits the advantage of a sole proprietorship in some jurisdictions. Companies under professional trade licenses require a UAE national as a local service agent to complete the judicial formalities. The local service agent charges a fixed annual fee and has no other involvement in the company. This is not the case in mainland business setup, where the company is owned by a UAE national with 51% partnership.<br><br>
